#Classification
Data mining-1 
The objective of this project is to develop object classification solutions using classical machine learning methods.
This involved an object recognition task. 
Each object is represented by a 28x28 dimensional image in a single 'flattened' 784 dimensional vector with an associated label (+1 or -1).
Xtrain: Training Data (each row is a single image) 
Ytrain: Training labels
Xtest: Test labels (each row is a single image)
